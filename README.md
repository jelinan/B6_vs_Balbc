This repository contains codes for the anylysis of sequencing data from mice gut and skin microbiome, which are part of a project Genetic background and commensal microbiome drive the susceptibility to epicutaneous sensitization and food allergy development in adjuvant-free experimental mouse model. Raw data from the sequencing facility were checked for the quality, trimmed and merged. Paired-end reads were demultiplexed using custom R script available in github repository. Demultiplexed data were than uploaded to Qiime2 version 2024.2 and further processed. Beta diveristy plots were generated and the outputs were used for visualization in R.
